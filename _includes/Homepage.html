      On designs, I'm collaborating with Aryaman to refine the Jekyll Garden
      theme, focusing on minimalism and automating the logs page to streamline
      Hiran.in. Additionally, I'm involved in enhancing the UI of Grandhapura
      with Shiju Alex, committed to improving Payyans' UI with Subin. I have
      also committed some hours on UI/UX planning for CircuitVerse as they are
      preparing for 2024 GSoC.

      With a focus on optimising project investments, I'm experimenting with a
      new approach: investing 20 hours initially and then conducting a review.
      To support this method, I've transitioned my journal to a compact 40-page
      field-note format.
