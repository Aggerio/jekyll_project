This site is an extension of my notes in Obsidian. The markdown notes are automatically compiled into web pages us ng hosted in GithutilLia. I ain maintaining this Jekyll theme as an open source project. 

<br />
The homepage design draws inspiration from Paco's website. while coLours are based on Steph Ango's FLexoki. Matthew St.. reading list and Onuds bookmark inspired the idea of publishing Log Lists. The idea of providing asynchronous design coaching is inspired by Anthony Holaday, and Like every Now page, itG based on Derek Sive. Now Page concept.
