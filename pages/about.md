I’m a maker, product designer, and design mentor currently living in Bangalore, India. With over fourteen years of experience in designing type, product, brand, and strategies, I like to use design to solve problems that focuses on user needs, business success, and the possibilities of technology.

I was born in Palakkad, Kerala, and since 2004, I've been fortunate to have access to computers and the internet. The online world introduced me to tech communities, giving me the chance to understand and collaborate on FOSS projects. 

<br />
In 2006, I played a role in reimagining and reactivating [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing](https://smc.org.in/), where I volunteered in promotional graphic design. This opened up a new avenue for me to explore design, and soon it became my freelancing option. A year later, I took part in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) program.


<br />
In 2010, I founded saltmangotree, one of the first Indian digital marketing agencies, where I led the design and tech teams until its acquisition in 2013. Since then, I've been leading product design teams for companies of various sizes and sectors: BangTheTable (Civic Engagement, 2014-15), Quintype (Publishing, 2015-2020), and currently at Kaleyra (CPaaS, 2020-Present).

<br />
Outside of work, I enjoy building things and coaching designers and startups on problem-solving and design thinking. I co-created Malayaleegraphy, initiated Kerala Designer Co, and designed a couple of fonts — Dyuthi and Rufscript.

<br />
I'm also passionate about reading, watching movies, dabbling in amateur barista skills, and trying my hand at ink-pen sketching, urban photography, and people-watching.
